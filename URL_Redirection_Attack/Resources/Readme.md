# Url Redirection Attack

The website can redirect on external website
	http://192.168.56.102/index.php?page=redirect&site=instagram

As the redirection is given as query in URL (site=) we can try to change instagram to Borntosec like the copyright just under external link in the footer
	http://192.168.56.102/index.php?page=redirect&site=Borntosec
